# Contraception
Final assessment PSY6422- Visualising data on contraceptive use in Europe

This project aimed to explore the trends in contraception use in the last 30 years in Europe. The project initially explored many types of contraceptive use but then was whittled down to condom, implant, injection, IUD and the pill use. This was purely based off an interest in hormonal contraceptives and a seemingly obvious comparison to the physical barrier contraception (condoms). Details on where the dataset was collected is in the codebook, please note that the dataset collected was a part of a larger dataset consisting of 4 excel spreadsheets. The data, code and original code book can be found via this reference: 
Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network. Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 (GBD 2019) Contraceptive Prevalence Estimates 1970-2019. Seattle, United States of America: Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), 2022.


If you are downloading the dataset, please do not unzip this as the code has been written to treat the datafile as a zipped file. Also ensure that the dataset is within a folder called rawdata, this is so the code can find the file. 

Although no statistical analysis was conducted, there appears to be an increasing use of condoms prevalence, perhaps a steady increase in implants and injections, the pill appears rather stable and a slight reduction in IUD use. This project was inspired by the research/general rhetoric that women/girls arenâ€™t happy with hormonal contraception, so it would be interesting to see if this affects the mean use
